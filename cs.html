C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).

        <i>C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen. The most recent version is 8.0, which was released in 2019 alongside Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3.</i>
